# Who did What

Chapter 1 - 5 are directly copied from [old Principia](https://github.com/LogicalAtomist/principia).

I started this project by
- Dividing each chapters into separate files
- Setting up a Rocq project to contain the files
- Fixing stuck proofs through ch 1-5
- Starting the formalization from Chapter 9.
- Simplifying `Nicod1_4.v`, `Yuelin.v`, `Jorgensen3_47.v` in Landon's original repository, cutting down 40% of their original LoC
