# Who did What

All of chapter 1 - 5 are directly attributed to [Landon's formalization of Principia](https://github.com/LogicalAtomist/principia).

I started this project by
- Making chapter 1 - 5 into a Rocq project
- Simplifying `Nicod1_4.v`, `Yuelin.v`, `Jorgensen3_47.v`, `Lemma5_7.v` in Landon's original repository, cutting down 20% of their original LoC and greatly enhance their readability
- Simplifying, bug-picking chapter 1 - 5, reducing ~ 700 LoC in total
- Starting the formalization from Chapter 9
