# Who did What

Chapter 1 - 5 are directly copied from [old Principia](https://github.com/LogicalAtomist/principia).

I started this project by
- Dividing each chapters into separate files
- Setting up a Rocq project to contain the files
- Fixing stuck proofs through ch 1-5
- Starting the formalization from Chapter 9.
