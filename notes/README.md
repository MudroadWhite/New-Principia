# Notes

This folder is intended to record the tricks, hacks, and other notes being necessary to write down.

TODO:
- create a progress file for PM
- learn how to organize the commits
- expect someone generously tell me what does license do
- create a CI in the future
- Can I understand `significant` as less than being a "valid type" and more than being inhabited?
