Proof.

Qed.

(* cf.p.51: To instantiate variables appeared in a propositional function, we use 
the concept of "individual", designed as as wrapper just to tag an real variable. 
This allows easy identification on them and they are free to be created everywhere *)
Definition Individual (s : string) : Prop. Admitted.
Example var_0 := Individual "x".

(* cf.p.51: `!` notation *)
(* Unsatisfying: what we want to express is that Phi takes argument with the same typf of `X` *)
Definition Predicate (Phi : Prop -> Prop) (X : Prop) := (fun x => Phi X).
(* We are allowed to directly fix the X without fixing the function, which is a main feature for this operator *)
Definition Predicvate_app (X : Prop) (Phi : Prop -> Prop) := predicate_bang Phi X.

(* TODO: maybe we should synthesize these 2 types into one inductive type with the name of "constituent" *)

(* Experimental:
We might want to design an explicit `Asserted` and make notation as `[| |]`
to separate the parameters with the content inside
so that real variables doesn't pollute the `forall`s, `exists` at the rhs 
of the definition

`n9_13` in this way, will be written as
```
Definition n9_13 (Phi : Prop → Prop) (X : Prop) : 
  [| Phi X = (∀ y : Prop, Phi y) |]. 
Admitted.
```
which is significantly different and makes more sense over its original formation

Cons:
1. MP will be affected by this embedding
2. How do we perform all kinds of rewrites?

Axiom Asserted : Prop -> Prop.

(* Draft, experimental: 
design `^` for a proposition, which abstracts it into a prop function
Idea: 
Functions in Principia seems not to be a 1st class member. They are being abstracted from existing 
propositions with a operation `^` on these proposition's variables, even before these proposition
variables are being instantiated.

TODO: cite the page for `^`'s definition

if we have a proposition `X /\ Y`, we can write something like
`^ X` on `X /\ Y` to abstract the proposition into a function, and also making 
it a function on `X`. p.15 of Principia says that we want `^X` on `X /\ Y` should 
be the same as `^Y` on `Y /\ X`. This is a different mechanics from the function system 
nowadays

In particular, `X` being hatted is still a variable being not instantiated, and determining
`X` is different from, and not the reversed procedure of hatting `X`.

hat (P : Prop -> Prop) (X : Prop) :
  hat (P X) (X) = P
  where P has become the represesntation of a function
*)

(* Draft, experimental:
Design a `comma` predicate  which works like a `id` 
`to enforce "lazy evaluation" on quantifiers 
*)

~p.14:
- propositional function: the functions that we usually concern, like `Phi` `Psi` etc..

~p.17:
- descriptive funstion: a special kind of propositional function, including examples like `x is blue`
- `~` is not a primitive idea. It is supposed to have a different definition on different types of proposition. 
For example, we might define `~` a typeclass, and `forall` propositions has an instance of implementation for 
this operator

~p.18:
apparent variable "appears to be" the only variables, while "real variables" include the actual variants to be concluded

~p.20: 
- (Ax, Px -> Q x) -> (Ax, Px) -> (Ax, Qx) requires that P Q takes arguments "of the same type". -> p.49
- formal implication: the `->` wrapped up in `forall`s. It bypassed the problem that `P -> Q = ~P \/ Q`, and restrict that we have to 
know `forall x, P x -> Q x` and `P X` to get `Q X`.

~p.22:
(TODO)`=` is not defined until chapter 13, and this is being explained in chapter 2/chapter II.

~p.40:
- a nice counterexample to test a function P is well typed is to see if `P P` can be formed
- `P P` is also an example that `P` is *impossible* to be a value of `P`
- P with "all possible values" are called `significant`. Significant = "well typed"

~p.47, beginning of chapter II:
- `forall x, Phi x` is considered as a function with `Phi` as one argument
- for `forall`, `Phi` can be a parameter but an individual `X` cannot be a parameter
- it is necesssary to make a distinction between passing in a `X` and passing in a `Phi`

~p.49:
- We can construct a function taking 2 arguments, and return either a function of function or a function of individual. 
It turns out that the return type is untyped. To enforce the return type with a fixed type, we have to enforce arguments
of a function taking the same type

~p.50:
- A propositional function could possibly contain apparent variables. We can eliminate apparent variables 
  and source them back to real variables
- matrix: A function made up of no apparent variable, to generate a "matrix" of elementary propositions

~p.51:
- predicate: first order functions. Only takes individuals as parameters
- Phi ! x^: any Phi that is a first order function/predicate and takes an variable of `x`'s type
- Phi ! x: `Phi ! x^` instantiated by `x`
- `Phi ! x^` could be the type of a real variable which is not an individual
- "Individual" is the best thing to instantiate a function's parameters
- (TODO)They are designed to be not propositions. Why?
- (TODO)Why we have to design the hierarchy for "functions" and "propositions " separately?

~p.52:
- `!` notation also seems to be used only when the function is being considered as a variable(at rhs)? And for all other cases, they are 
  supposed to be fixed(at rhs)?
- `!`'s summary: this is not a notation just for first order functions, but it's more like a notation for function being identified as 
  a variable at rhs

~p.56:
- the axiom of reducibility: "any" properties should have a equivalent of itself in a collection of properties

~p.57:
- exaplained a proof of identity `=` informally, only to be complete with the support of axiom of reducibility

~p.94:
- (notes on *1.01)the rules for definitional equality is out of the theory

~p.127:
- Chapter II has explained that ~ and \/ should have different meaning on different propositions. Guess: we cannot define a
negation on "all" propositions attributing to Russell's paradox

~p.128:
- Goal of ch9: focus on definition of `~` and `\/` defined in *1 - *5 limited to eprops. Extend their definitions to 1st orde props
- The support of `forall` and `exists` seems to be only for demonstration purpose - if we take them as primitive ideas, we can 
  conclude "upgraded" versions of propositions "just as in" ch1-5.
- the important parts seems to be *1.2 - *1.6; A new way is used for analogue of 1.7 - 1.72
- Real variables doesn't have types(??), and can be instantiated with any proposition of any orders???
- Summary:
  - elementary propositions are initially admitted, along with their types
  - definition of `~` and `\/` depends on proposition types
  - definition of function depends on type of `~` and `\/`
  - order of a proposition depends on its parameter's types

~p.138:
- Ch9 enables us to take `forall` propositions as parameters
- therefore we can have a better goal(?)
- Goal of ch10: focus on deducing 1-var functions from 
- "for example", `exists` is no longer a primitive idea which is different from ch9  
- several ch9 theorems are only taken because of their ability to reason for quantified propositions

~p.162:
- (TODO) propositions is defined in p.43. They are supposed to be incomplete symbols, but individuals are complete 
  so they are not propositions
- matrix is predicative function as a definition
- starting from chapter 12, all variables are either matrixes or individuals
- propositions being used as variables(??) will no longer be used
